# DHC *README FILE* & *REFLECTION*
## Required Techniques (Must Have):

- Create a page with an external CSS style sheet
Somewhat scattered, with the @fontface done at the bottom and some notes I left over. This technique really has helped me unclutter
all of my htmls.

- Add hover effects to enhance interactivity
I added hover to the button links of the events and classes, which turn purple upon hover. I also added an active effect that changes
the button to gold. This I hope increases likelihood to click.

- Use an external font that is self-hosted
- Use an external font from a font library
Both self-hosted and font library fonts were done through downloading methods and both are available through the workshop.html site. I used 3 different fonts, a drippy paint font for the headers of EVENTS and CLASSES. A finger paint font for the link text and a fancy font for the introduction to the link lists.

- Select at Least Three Additional Techniques:

## Experiment with different font styles

- Adjust font-weight for emphasis
- Use text-decoration to add or remove underlines, lines through text, etc.
Had to use text-decoration most particularly in the button links, in order to more throroughly customize their appearance, especially disengaging the visuals of the list.

- Adjust spacing (letter-spacing, line-height, or word spacing) for readability
I also used line-height in the button link layout in order to improve their readibility, particularly because without it they were overlapping. Just a little bit of distance and it was perfect.

- Align text or elements for a clean layout
I tend to align and margin in order to find the best placement for navigation bars or while I'm trying to find the most pleasing way to place a paragraph. Such as the intro to the links <p> in the workshop.html page.

- Try pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes for additional styling effects
