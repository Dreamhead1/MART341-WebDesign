# DHC *README FILE* & *REFLECTION*

## Required Techniques (Must Have):
##

# - Choose the Website You‚Äôll Showcase (Your final project must reflect and provide evidence of each area below):

    My showcased website would be my Dreamhead Citizen site, from Assignment 13.

#

# üå± 1. Your Growth
#
## -  What skills did you improve the most? (e.g., programming, design, planning, version control, etc.)
Previously before this class I had taken Creative Coding with Michael Cassens, so I felt somewhat prepared to tackle
it all... And I was right, though what I remembered was a dilapidated version of what it once was. So I feel as if
my programming and design were well-exercised and I definitely watched progress be made in those fields. Though I
will admit that I struggled with planning. Having a blank canvas is always somewhat troubling, but I felt my inner
eyes creative muscle really flex as I got deeper into the skill week by week.

## - What transferrable skills did you build on or develop throughout the course?
Problem-solving, adaptibility, creativity and attention to detail are all skills that I feel I have built onto heavily.
Though I still feel stuck somewhat in communication and time-management, I feel as if I really hit a hot-spot when it 
comes to adaptibility. There were many times my pages would encounter bugs and sometimes I realized I didn't have the
knowledge, time and skill to defeat them. So adapting to a more comfortable build, through clutch problem-solving
inner dialogue became the muscle I trained the most. As it dragged me out of sticky and infuriating situations.
#

# üåê 2. Web Presence
#
## - Demonstrate how you built, improved, or maintained a website.
Often I would use the previous websites I have built in order to conceptualize on how I wanted to begin design and planning.
There were many times I found the concept of the website and found contemporaries on the web in order to get a more concise
idea on the norms and abnormal strategies in design. Through-out the class I used 8 out of the 15 weeks here to focus on my
Dreamhead Citizen site, that I would each assignment try to improve every single page and aspect to create a slightly more
pleasent and effective site than last week. It was very fun, it felt like I confronted something I was scared to face-up
and succeeded with grace. I was very proud of the balance, color theory, font styling and application of this page...

## - Describe what strategies helped? (e.g., project planning, comments, responsiveness)
Strategies that proved the most useful was the border box technique, understanding how to layer inside out felt very
important to making the process so much more intuitive. My ambition was high, and so were my google searches. Guiding
from W3, to coding forums, to the MART 341 website was so necessary to figuring out how to proceed in many sticky or
confusing situations. Similarly divs and css became my best friend very quickly into my time in web design.
#

# üíª 3. Technical Skills
#
## - Demonstrate your proficiency in HTML, CSS, and responsive design.
I feel as if my proficiency in html, css and responsive design is more easily shown than explained, but if I were to
try my best... I feel as if keeping html pages as clean as possible and commenting on the purpose of different divs
and sections became more of a late-game lesson. But truly helped marvels with proficient and efficient design... 
When it comes to CSS, I would copy the tags I wanted to class or id and paste them into CSS notes, so I wouldn't
have to keep swinging back and forth between html and CSS. Similarly focusing on organization in CSS was just as
important if not more than html, simply because I realized it slowed me down when I would have classes or ids clash 
or had unorganized sections of code that would be bugged and not even work. Having to find and fix this could've
been proactively avoided... So I learned to... Responsive design was a later game subject, so I feel as if my
proficiency of it was less particular, but doing mobile first designs through specifying @media just for computer
sized screens definitely was my sharpest growth.

## - Include visual examples such as (Media queries, Flexible layouts, Polished designs):
Layout design was my favorite, I would often first figure out where my nav bar would go. At the top, on the side, 
hover drop-downs, etc... Then I would use border-box methods to polish this design through fixing the rhthym of 
color theory and while also breaking the mold enough to incorporate some variety in design. Media queries were
more late in the game, though they were very interesting to adapt to, especially in adding fonts or specifying
aspects dependent on screen-size. I felt it was a great addition, and something I feel compelled to practice
in the near future.

## - Problem-solving during setbacks (this could be a before-and-after set of screenshots)
Problem-solving to me incorporated two steps primarily, first the google dive. Where I would figure out what
the internet sensei would do in my situation. Second I would turn the bugged or problematic blocks of code into
notes, then restart with the notes as a guide in order to get a more polished block of code.
#

# üõ†Ô∏è 4. Tools & Frameworks; Explain how you used tools like:
#
## - GitHub/GitHub Pages/GitHub Desktop
Github was as quintessential as any other program, and very enlightening to learn how to use somewhat more. I'm
not going to lie, I was quite intimidated by github when I first started using it. Especially when it came to GH
Pages, where I would always accidentally delete my host site link then panic and not know what to do. But eventually
I started learning more about how the site functioned, and I became more comfortable at making mistakes and coming
back from it. GH Desktop I struggled taking the comments for the commits and pushes seriously, I was so impatient
turn in the assignment or keep coding I would just brain vomit. So unfortunately I feel as if my communication of
the changes suffered drastically. This is something I feel is necessary to slow down into and improve on.

## - Visual Studio Code, Frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap)
VSC became very familiar and very comforting after losing my temper and eventually finding it back once I debugged
my htmls/css'. It truly is an amazing software, just as crucial as Github was to these skills to develop. Though when
it came to frameworks, I was honestly kind of disappointed. I have an inherently creative-craving mind, so being limited
to how the framework would build was somewhat frustrating. But eventually I understood how useful it could be if I let
go of my creative ego.

## - Describe what made your workflow smoother or more effective?
What made my workflow smoother and more effective would be most likely organization and description of content within
my html and CSS pages. Taking more creative liberties also surprisingly was rewarding for my workflow as well, as it
began training my mind to recognize opportunities to balance new content into the current.
#

# üé® 5. Creative Thinking
#
## - Describe how you applied design principles and creative strategies. How did these improve your designs (through visual appeal, accessibility, functionality, etc.)
I feel as if trying to visualize the page from inside out made it much more balanced, clean and aligned. Simulataneously
 to noting what I wanted out of each page and each div within said page became so so so useful in applying my skills. As 
 otherwise I was stumbling in a creative darkness, I had something to give but I didn't know where or how to give it. Once 
 I figured that our, sectioning the page into classified divs was ridiculously helpful, it made coding 2x easier within 
 one day of practice. Similarly listening to my ambition and not limiting myself to what I think or know I can or can't do
 was very helpful.

## - What inspired you throughout the semester?
My biggest three inspirations were, one the relation to my professional life as an artist, two the fun of a new creative
field of creation, and three I was very inspired by how patient you were, how well layed out the class was and how smoothly
our learned skills transitioned to harder and harder skills. I felt very taken care of as a student and am very proud of the
skills I developed. This pride could very well by a fourth inspiration even.

## - From where did your best ideas spark‚Äîprofessional work, peer review, previous projects, feedback, or elsewhere?
Peer review was often pretty good for brain-storming design, though primarily it was a trial and error type path for me.
Otherwise I was keeping up on the design of websites that were contemporaries to the same concept or theme mine follows.
