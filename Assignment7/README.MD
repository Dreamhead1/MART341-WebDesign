# DHC *README FILE* & *REFLECTION*

## Share the aspect of your website youâ€™re most proud of and why. Focus on specific design choices, functionality, or features that stand out.
I'm most impressed by being able to include my animation or video. I made it auto play, have video control options and I am very happy I could even include it in the first place. I began it as an <img> but had to research what actually worked for it. 
## How are things going for you right now, and is there anything specific I can do to support you or improve your experience?
Things are a little overwhelming but I'm taking it at a confident and slow pace, so I'd say I'm doing it alright.
