## Required Techniques (Must Have):
    All on workshop.html and the workshop style.css in the Style folder...
##

- Sizing – Control the width and height of elements on the page.
    I used sizing to create the borders within the borders, while also using it in my absolute positioning
    of the drop-down content.
    #
- Border – Define and style borders around elements for emphasis or separation.
    Used to create a sense of repetition and symmetry on the page.
    #
- Margin – Adjust the space outside an element, creating separation from other elements.
    I used margins extensively, especially while wanting to position without having to absolute position items.
    #
- Padding – Set the space inside an element, between its content and border.
    Padding was used harmonize the elements within my content boxes, making it evening spaced between the borders.
    #
- Display: Inline / Inline-block . Specify how elements are displayed in relation to others.
    Used with absolute positioning to create the dropped nav within the drop down
    #
- Dropdown – Create a dropdown menu for navigation or content organization.
    Drop-down was used to declutter the page and its content, while making it more fun to access simultaneously to 
    making it more organized to interact with.
