# DHC *README FILE* & *REFLECTION*

## Required Techniques (Must Have):
##

- At Least 4 Pages – Your website should contain a minimum of four distinct pages that align with a cohesive theme.
    
    workshop.html -> collective.html -> collectiveFile.html -> confirmationPage.html
    #
- Responsive Design – Ensure the website layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

    #
- Media Queries – Use CSS media queries to make design adjustments at specific screen widths for optimal user experience on all devices.

    #
- Navigation Menu – Include a clear, user-friendly navigation menu to allow visitors to easily access each page of the site.

    Patternized nav bar, I basically copy-pasted the design and made sure the semantics. Done to give a back option, a home option, an about option and a support option.
    #
- Dropdown Menu – Add a dropdown menu within the navigation for sub-pages or sections, if applicable.

    Drop-down was used to declutter the page and its content, while making it more fun to access simultaneously to 
    making it more organized to interact with.
