# DHC *README FILE* & *REFLECTION*

## Note how you applied the balance concepts we’ve discussed this week. How did adjusting width or background color help improve your layout?
    I definitely considered balance in the design of my website, particularly the homepage having an asymmetrical
    balance. I wanted the about to be symmetrical though since it was all text. Using center alignment, color repetition and navigational hierarchy as well.
## How did your final design compare to your initial idea? Did the balance and layout turn out as expected, or did you have to make adjustments along the way?
    I mainly just stumbled in with a vague idea that I like center alignment... The balance came depending on whether I was using text or images in the page; asymmetrical for images and symmetrical for text. My final design honestly makes me quite happy.
## Additionally, reflect on any challenges you faced during this assignment and how you overcame them. Did you encounter any issues with balancing content or using CSS? How did you solve them?
    Most my challenges have bee style based, such as wanting to change how a texts background color wraps over it. But beyond that I feel pretty confident I knew how to do most what I wanted to do
## Finally, how are you doing? Is there anything specific I can do to support you in this class or beyond—whether it’s technical help or connecting you with additional resources?
    I'm doing great! I don't need anything extraneous, just thoroughly enjoying the semester.
## If you experimented with float and margin, please tell me about your experience.
    It was necessary to please the perfectionist in my brain. It helped me develop asymmetrical balance on the homepage with the images and I also used it to create a spaced navigation bar beneath the website header/title. It was really useful to know about this!
