Three website ideas I'd be interested in exploring, you ask?... hmmm...
        </h2>
        <p>
            My intentions with what I learn here is eventually to be able to manage a business as an artist with a website that
        <ul>
<li>Advertizes service, such as mural painting, live performance contact, or commissions</li>
<li>Has a catalogue of all my work</li>
<li>And a link to another website I plan to build...</li>
        </ul>

        <p> My second idea is to make a Artist Collective website, one that helps promote, find and hold catalogues for artists</p> <br />

        <p> Last but not least is perhaps a website with code built animations? I feel like that would be an awesome source of inspiration</p> <br />

        <p> here is my girlfriend and I doing a live painting performance </p> <br />
