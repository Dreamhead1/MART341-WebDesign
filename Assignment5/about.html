        <h1> Why I chose these website ideas</h1>
        <ol>
            <li> <h2>Online Portforlio</h2> </li>
            <p> Through this website I hope to advertize services I could provide, such as Art Therapy, Murals, Commissions, Catalogue, Portfolio, and an about me section (the least fun)... </p>
            <li> <h2>Art Collective</h2> </li>
            <p> This website is my attempt to start a community where artists can go to eachother for help, in every way I could hope to think of... <br />
            My end goal is to host festivals, concerts, auctions, galleries, vending opportunities, and give a way for people to find artists within the ranks and vice versa.</p>
            <li> <h2>Coded Animation Archive</h2></li>
            <p> I was just trying to think of a website that I'd love to just explore, and such would be an archive of many creative coders and their works... <br />
                In order to both inspire and stimulate in the search of art!</p>
