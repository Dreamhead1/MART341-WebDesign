# DHC *README FILE* & *REFLECTION*

## Replace it with the following list of techniques you'll use this week. As you work through the assignment, track how and why you used each technique on your new page. Note: Your README.md is worth 3 points this week (please don't skip it). (e.g., "Div: I used <div> elements to group the recipes on my page. This helped organize the layout and provides a framework for future pages.")
